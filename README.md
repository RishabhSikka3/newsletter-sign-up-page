## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

### What I learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of:

- Using the `<picture>` element to serve responsive images based on screen width.
- Creating form validation logic with JavaScript using regex.

### Continued development

Areas I want to focus on in future projects:

- Accessibility practices such as ARIA roles and screen reader support

- Enhancing the UI responsiveness with more precise breakpoints and layouts

- Building reusable components in frameworks like React or Vue
